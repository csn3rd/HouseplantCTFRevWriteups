Ok, I think I made it slightly better. Now you won't get the flag this time!

Dev: William

File: pass1.py



Solution:

In this python program, the main method calls the checkpass function which returns a boolean. When checkpass returns true, we have unlocked the password.

Taking a look at the checkpass function, we see that the program is taking user input and returning whether it matches a given string. The strings are directly compared so we have found the flag. No extra work needed for this challenge. We can just copy paste the flag.
