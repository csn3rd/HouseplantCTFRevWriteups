Can you help me move my stuff? This one's fragile!

Solution:

In this Java program, the main method takes user input and strips the rtcp{} format, passing the string as a parameter into the check function.

In the check function, we see that the input string must be 15 characters long or else the function will return false. We also see that a string called theflag is created by adding the ascii values of flag and input at each position. At the end, it compares the string to their encoded string.

Now that we understand the check function, we can reverse this easily by subtracting the corresponding ascii values.

Code: fragile_solve.java

import java.util.*;

public class fragile_solve {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
    	String a = "ÐdØÓ§åÍaèÒÁ¡";
    	String b = "h1_th3r3_1ts_m3";
    	String c = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
        	c += (char)((int)a.charAt(i)-(int)b.charAt(i));
        }
        System.out.println((c));
    }
}


We can create a string a which will be the encoded string we are given. We can crate a string b which will be the flag string we are given. Then, we create a string c by going through each position, subtracting the ascii value of the character in b at the position from the ascii value of the character in a at the position. We then take this ascii value and convert it to the corresponding character and add it to c.

After running the code, we get the string: "h3y_1ts_n0t_b4d"

Flag: rtcp{h3y_1ts_n0t_b4d}
