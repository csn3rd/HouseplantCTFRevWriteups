I made a password system, bet you can't get the flag

Dev: William

File: pass0.py



Solution:

In this Python program, there are a bunch of print statements. Running the program shows that we have been rickrolled.

In the code itself, there is a print statement containing the flag that has been commented out. No work needed for this challenge. We can just copy paste the flag.

Flag: rtcp{tH1s_i5_4_r3aL_fL4g_s0_Do_sUbm1T_1t!}
