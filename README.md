This is the repository containing the first 9 reverse engineering challenges in Houseplant CTF and their solutions.

The writeups folder contain all of my writeups, which include the problem statement, my analysis, and if needed, the code for the solution script.

The solutionprograms folder contains all of my solution code that can be run to get the flag.
